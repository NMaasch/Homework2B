# Homework2B

Part B of this homework requires created a plane that uses a height map and
distorts the vertices. Also to include bodies of water where there is sea level and reflects.
In addition, a cube map is to be used for surrounding area.

I put a height map on a plane. Distorted the plane and also used reflect/refracting code upon the vertices
that were at sea level to replicate water. The cubemap I used was of a mountainous area next to a body of water.
Added a script that adjusts the distortion of the plane over time.
